Create a GraphQL API to access your mongoDB Database via Apollo Server,
then implement a subgraph with Apollo Server.

What is useful information do I need to access/distribute on an API level?
- Music
- Playlists
- Mixes
- Links??

Can this project be leveled up so that I have a chatGPT-like assistant
that can intelligently retrieve the information I ask it for?
